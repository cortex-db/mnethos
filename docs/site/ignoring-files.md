# .ignore

Mnethos respects your existing `.gitignore` and `.ignore` patterns automatically. If you've already set up `.gitignore` for your project, you're done. Mnethos reads it and applies those rules immediately.

The system is designed to work the way you'd expect: keep sensitive files out of Git with `.gitignore`, and use `.ignore` when you need to hide files from Mnethos's context without affecting Git.

## Quick Start

**Already have a `.gitignore`?** You're done. Mnethos uses it automatically.

**Need additional ignore rules?** Create a `.ignore` file in your project root.

**Files still showing up?** Check [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

## How It Works

Mnethos checks multiple ignore sources when deciding whether to show a file. Here's the order of precedence (highest to lowest):

1. **`.ignore` files** - Highest priority, overrides everything else
2. **`.gitignore` files** - Standard Git ignore patterns
3. **Global gitignore** - Your personal ignore file (`~/.config/git/ignore`)
4. **`.git/info/exclude`** - Repository-specific excludes

**Key rule:** `.ignore` always wins. If you whitelist a file in `.ignore` (using `!pattern`), it will be visible even if `.gitignore` hides it.

### What Gets Filtered Out

Mnethos automatically skips:

- **Files matched by ignore patterns** - Checked in the precedence order above
- **Binary files** - Non-text content is excluded
- **Hidden files** - Files starting with `.` (except in your project root)

**Hidden file examples:**

- `.env` in project root → **Visible**
- `.env` in `src/` subdirectory → **Hidden**
- `.cache/` directory → **Hidden** (starts with `.`)
- `src/.DS_Store` → **Hidden** (hidden file in subdirectory)

**To show a hidden file:** Add `!.filename` to your `.ignore` file

## Troubleshooting

### I Can't Find My File

**First, figure out WHY it's hidden.** Common causes:

1. **Matched by an ignore pattern** (`.gitignore` or `.ignore`)
2. **Hidden file or directory** (starts with `.` and not in project root)
3. **Binary or non-text file** (Mnethos skips these)

**Check if Git is ignoring it:**

```bash
git check-ignore -v path/to/file
```

**Example output:**

```
.gitignore:3:node_modules/    node_modules/package/index.js
```

This means line 3 of `.gitignore` is hiding it.

**Important:** `git check-ignore` only checks `.gitignore` patterns. It won't tell you if a file is hidden by `.ignore` or other Mnethos-specific filters.

**If `git check-ignore` shows nothing but the file is still hidden:**

- Check your `.ignore` file (Git doesn't know about `.ignore` files)
- Verify the file isn't in a hidden directory (like `.cache/`)
- Confirm it's a text file, not binary

**To make a file visible:**

If hidden by `.gitignore`, add to `.ignore`:

```
!path/to/file
```

If it's a hidden file (starts with `.`), add to `.ignore`:

```
!.important-config
```

**Remember:** Changes to ignore files require restarting your Mnethos session.

### My Ignore Patterns Aren't Working

**Pattern syntax checklist:**

- Use `/` for paths (even on Windows): `src/build/` not `src\build\`
- Add trailing `/` for directories: `dist/` not `dist`
- Patterns are relative to the ignore file location
- Use `*` for wildcards: `*.log` matches all `.log` files
- Use `**` for recursive matching: `**/temp/` matches `temp/` anywhere

**Test your pattern:**

```bash
# Check if a specific file matches
git check-ignore -v path/to/file
# Find all files matching a pattern
find . -name "*.log"
# Check which of those are ignored
git check-ignore -v $(find . -name "*.log")
```

**Precedence issues:**

If a file should be ignored but isn't:

1. Check if it's whitelisted with `!` in a `.ignore` file
2. Verify the pattern is in the right ignore file (`.ignore` overrides `.gitignore`)
3. Check for more nested ignore files that might override parent patterns

**Still not working?**

- Verify your ignore file is saved
- Restart your Mnethos session (ignore rules are loaded at startup)
- Check for typos in file paths

### Still Having Issues?

If you've tried the steps above and still can't figure out why a file is hidden or visible, export your session diagnostics:

```
:dump html
```

Then share the output in [Discord](https://discord.gg/kRZBPPkgwq) along with:

1. **The specific file path** you're trying to ignore or include
2. **Your `.gitignore` and `.ignore` contents** (or the relevant patterns)
3. **What you expected** vs. what's actually happening
4. **Output from** `git check-ignore -v path/to/file`

This information helps us debug whether it's a pattern issue, precedence problem, or something else entirely.
